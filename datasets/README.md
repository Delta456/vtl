# VTL Datasets

This module exposes some functionalities to download and use the VTL datasets.
For this we created some batch based iterators to load the datasets.
We expose the following datasets:

- **Mnist**: A dataset of handwritten digits.
- **Imdb**: A dataset of IMDB reviews for sentiment analysis.
